Launch Instructions for GUI:

- To run program using the javax Swing GUI, simply launch ImageEditor via the command line with no arguments.
  Then, interact with the program via the buttons on the right hand side. Images will be rendered in
  the center of the window, with histograms of each channel and the intensity of the current
  image visible on the left hand side.

- Button Commands Supported
    - Load
      - Opens a file window to read in a file to the program. Prompts user for name of image.
        and stores result in model at provided name.
    - Save
      - Prompts user for filepath and saves current image rendered to location.
        and stores result in model at provided name.
    - Visualize
      - Asks user for parameter then transforms currently rendered image
        and stores result in model at provided name.
    - Brighten
      - Asks user for value to brighten/darken by then transforms currently rendered image
        and stores result in model at provided name.
    - Sepia
      - Transforms currently rendered image and stores result in model at provided name.
    - Greyscale
      - Transforms currently rendered image and stores result in model at provided name.
    - Blur
      - Transforms currently rendered image and stores result in model at provided name.
    - Sharpen
      - Transforms currently rendered image and stores result in model at provided name.
    - Render new image
      - Takes name of image and attempts to render the image stored in the model under that name.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

- To instead run the program entirely in the terminal, launch ImageEditor.java via the command line 
  and include the first image you would like to load into the program (see syntax for the load 
  command below). Further commands for transformations and file I/O can be similarly entered via the
  command line. 

List of Accepted Commands and Example Syntax

- Load
  - syntax: "load filepath imageID"
  - Ex: "load example.ppm example" or "load ex2.jpg ex2"
  - Loads the image file at the specified file path into the model, assigning the provided imageID
    as the identifier for the image.

- Brighten
  - syntax: "brighten value imageID newImageID"
  - Ex: "brighten 15 example example-bright" or "brighten -15 example example-dark"
  - Brightens or darkens the image contained at imageID by the value passed, storing the result in
    the model as newImageID. If passed a positive value performs brightening, otherwise darkens image.
    clamps values at 255.

- Visualize
  - syntax: "channel-component imageID newImageID"
  - Ex: "red-component example example-red", "blue-component example example-blue",
        "green-component example example-green", "luma-component example example-luma"
        "value-component example example-value", "intensity-component example example-intensity"
  - Visualizes the image contained at imageID along the channel specified, storing the result in
    the model as newImageID.

- Blur
  - syntax: "blur imageID newImageID"
  - Ex: "blur ex2 example-blur"
  - Brightens or darkens the image contained at imageID by the value passed, storing the result in
    the model as newImageID. If passed a positive value performs brightening, otherwise darkens image.
    clamps values at 255.

- Sharpen
  - syntax: "sharpen imageID newImageID"
  - Ex: "sharpen ex2 example-sharp"
  - Brightens or darkens the image contained at imageID by the value passed, storing the result in
    the model as newImageID. If passed a positive value performs brightening, otherwise darkens image.
    clamps values at 255.

- Greyscale
  - syntax: "greyscale imageID newImageID"
  - Ex: "greyscale ex2 example-greyscale"
  - Brightens or darkens the image contained at imageID by the value passed, storing the result in
    the model as newImageID. If passed a positive value performs brightening, otherwise darkens image.
    clamps values at 255.

- Sepia
  - syntax: "sepia imageID newImageID"
  - Ex: "sepia ex2 example-sepia"
  - Brightens or darkens the image contained at imageID by the value passed, storing the result in
    the model as newImageID. If passed a positive value performs brightening, otherwise darkens image.
    clamps values at 255.

- Quit
  - syntax: "q", "quit", "Q", "Quit", etc.
  - Ends the program,
